# Parking_lot-_managment_system
Senior project for ECE SUNY Politechnic 2022, includes mobile application, machine learning, GUI, RFID, RF mesh, Parking algor.

Efficient parking requires a line of sight to available parking locations. The loss of sight can happen due to high occupancy, multi-level garages, physical obstructions, and extreme parking lot size. If a system can determine availability beyond line of sight, then this information can be passed directly to the user, allowing the user to go directly to an open asset. The parking lot management system will use an android application with machine learning to offer prediction of availability. The system will authenticate users and communicate using RF technology. A camera system will identify parking occupancy using vision software. A parking matrix will determine an ideal spot and pass this information to the user through a centralized user interface. The system improves parking time by directing a user to their ideal location given the availability of assets. The system will improve safety by controlling traffic patterns, maintaining distance between known users in transit. The parking experience will be improved for any user that integrates into the system.
